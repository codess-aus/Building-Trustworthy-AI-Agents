## What You'll Learn

This guide is organized into three core chapters that cover the essential aspects of building trustworthy AI agents:

### 🚀 [Build & Deploy AI Agents](build-deploy/index.md)

Learn how to build and deploy safe and effective AI agents. This section covers:

- Architectural patterns for AI agents
- Best practices for agent design
- Deployment strategies and considerations
- Monitoring and observability
- Testing and validation approaches

### 🔒 [Security Considerations](security/index.md)

Understand the critical security aspects when developing AI agents:

- Authentication and authorization mechanisms
- Input validation and sanitization
- Threat modeling for AI systems
- Protecting against adversarial attacks
- Secure API design and implementation

### 🛡️ [Privacy & Data Protection](privacy/index.md)

Maintain data and user privacy throughout your AI agent development:

- Data governance frameworks
- Privacy-preserving techniques
- Compliance with regulations (GDPR, CCPA, etc.)
- Data minimization principles
- User consent and transparency

## Why Trustworthy AI Matters

Building trustworthy AI agents is not just about following best practices—it's about creating technology that:

- **Protects users**: Safeguards personal information and maintains privacy
- **Operates reliably**: Performs consistently and predictably in various scenarios
- **Maintains security**: Resists attacks and unauthorized access
- **Ensures compliance**: Meets regulatory requirements and industry standards
- **Builds confidence**: Earns user trust through transparent and responsible practices
